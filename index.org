A quick regime-switching look at ALGO’s "downside resilience".
#+end_quote

* TL;DR
Over the latest crypto selloff, many observers noted that *Algorand (ALGO) didn’t decline as much as the market*. 
A two-state Markov Switching (MS) model on ALGO vs. a crypto market proxy suggests:
- In the *High-Vol* state, ALGO tends to **outperform** the market.
- However, in the *Low-Vol* state, ALGO tends to **underperform** the market.

* Anecdotal Spark: “ALGO held up best”
Several posts on X highlighted ALGO’s relative resilience during the selloff. For example:
- [[https://x.com/algerstmehn/status/1977063165214228947][“ALGO held up well during the flush.”]]

[[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-11/crypto-s-record-selloff-sparks-intrigue-over-who-got-wiped-out][Context for just how rough that week was for the crypto market (record liquidations).]]

That got me wondering whether this wasn’t just a one-off anecdote, but part of a state-dependent pattern: does ALGO behave differently in high-volatility regimes vs low-volatility regimes?

So I ran a simple two-state Markov Switching model, and the result confirmed the community's intuition:

- In the high-vol state, ALGO outperforms the broad crypto market.
- In the low-vol state, ALGO underperforms.

Below I’ll outline the setup and what I think it implies for portfolio construction and risk management. I’ll fill in the exact estimates (tables/figures) as I finalize the empirical work.


* Data and Method Overview
- *Sample:* Weekly data from 1/2/2023 to 1/27/2025.  This excludes the recent redemption event which prompted this analysis.  I also estimated models with TVL high-minus-low and small-minus-big portfolios.  Diagnostic tests showed the CAPM specification is preferred.
- *Assets:* 
  - ALGO weekly close-to-close log returns.
  - Market proxy: Total Crypto Market Cap returns.
- *Model:* 
  - Markov-Switching model of ALGO excess returns with a crypto market factor (CAPM).
  - Regime-specific intercepts, betas, and volatility.
  - Additional 3-factor model includes a high-minus-low TVL, and small-minus-big crypto portfolios.

* Baseline: Standard One-Regime CAPM

First let's run a standard (one-regime) CAPM regression.

$$r_{algo,t} - r_f = \alpha_t + \beta_{M}(M_t - r_f) + \epsilon_t$$

Table 1 below shows a negative and significant alpha coefficient, and a beta coefficient of 1.39 which means ALGO has a bit more systematic risk than the average crypto asset. The error term's standard deviation---a measure of ALGO's typical return after controlling for market movements---is about 12% per week.

* Headline Findings:  Two-Regime Markov Switching Model

The two-state Markov Switching crypto market model takes the form:

$$r_{i,t} - r_{f,t} = 
\begin{cases}
\alpha_1 + \beta_1(r_{m,t} - r_{f,t}) + \epsilon_{1,t}, & \text{if } s_t = 1 \\
\alpha_2 + \beta_2(r_{m,t} - r_{f,t}) + \epsilon_{2,t}, & \text{if } s_t = 2
\end{cases}$$

where $\epsilon_{j,t} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_j)\ for \ j \in \{1, 2\}$.

and $P(S_t=s_t \mid S_{t-1}=s_{t-1}) = \begin{bmatrix}
p_{00} & p_{10} \\
1-p_{00} & 1-p_{10}
\end{bmatrix}$

** Tables

Below are results from a Markov-Switching CAPM regression with 2 regimes.

Table 2 shows coefficients from the low volatility regime. ALGO's beta on the crypto market is about 1, showing systematic risk commensurate with the market.  The alpha is negative and significant which reflects ALGO's underperformance over the period.  In this regime, the typical weekly return after controlling for market movements is about 6.6%.

#+caption: Low Volatility Regime Parameters
|            |    coef | Std Err. |      z | P>abs(z) | [0.025 | 0.975] |
|------------+---------+----------+--------+----------+--------+--------|
| $\alpha$   | -1.6282 |    0.740 | -2.201 |    0.028 | -3.078 | -0.179 |
| $\beta_M$  |  1.0391 |    0.125 |  8.296 |    0.000 |  0.794 |  1.285 |
| $\sigma^2$ | 43.6980 |    9.668 |  4.520 |    0.000 | 24.748 | 62.648 |

Table 3 shows coefficients from the high volatility regime.  The alpha is now positive, but insignificant. So in the high volatility regime, ALGO does not underperform the market portfolio.  The beta coefficient is higher at 2.41, showing more systematic risk in the high volatility regime.  In this regime, the typical weekly return after controlling for market movements is about 21.4%.
 
#+caption: High Volatility Regime Parameters
|            |     coef | Std, Err |     z | P>abs(z) |  [0.025 |  0.975] |
|------------+----------+----------+-------+----------+---------+---------|
| $\alpha$   |   3.9621 |    5.637 | 0.703 |    0.482 |  -7.087 |  15.011 |
| $\beta_M$  |   2.4169 |    0.730 | 3.310 |    0.001 |   0.986 |   3.848 |
| $\sigma^2$ | 460.1312 |  178.208 | 2.582 |    0.010 | 110.850 | 809.412 |

The regime transition parameters are shown in Table 4 below.  When ALGO is in the low volatility regime in a given week, it has a 96% probability of again being in the low volatility regime in the following week.  If ALGO is in the high volatility regime it has about an 85% chance of again being in the high volatility regime in the following week.  

#+caption: Regime transition parameters                         
|              |   coef | std_err |      z | P>abs(z) | [0.025 | 0.975] |
| p[Low->Low]  | 0.9626 |   0.026 | 36.529 |    0.000 |  0.911 |  1.014 |
| p[High->Low] | 0.1570 |   0.123 |  1.277 |    0.202 | -0.084 |  0.398 |


In sum:
- *State identification:* High-Vol spikes line up with overall market volatility.
- *Performance split:*
  - *Low-Vol:* $\alpha$ is **negative and significant**.
  - *High-Vol:* $\alpha$ is **positive but insignificant**.
- *Transition dynamics:* High-Vol is shorter-lived and clustered; Low-Vol dominates time-in-state.


* What might be the cause?

A couple possibilities are:

1) *Microstructure & positioning:* Lower leverage can dampen forced selling → relative strength on downside days.  
2) *Holder base & narrative:* A builder/payment/governance-tilted cohort may sell less aggressively in panics.  
3) *Fee/throughput stability:* Predictable L1 costs and throughput avoids fee shocks during congestion.

None is a silver bullet; together they plausibly yield downside resilience in high-volatility regimes.

* Bottom Line

Algo doesn’t lead in quiet markets, and the model results agree. But when volatility spikes, ALGO has tended to *lose less or even lead*. For investors able to monitor market volatility, this state-contingent resilience can be valuable---provided you can manage the *when* with a disciplined regime filter.
